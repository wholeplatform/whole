/**
 * Invariants:
 *   1) The same CompoundModel instance for all entities of a program (composition of models)
 *      Responsible for notification mechanism (listeners and notification)
 *      Mantained by IEntity.setModel: copy down all the hierarchy
 *      Structural setters indirectly updates CompoundModel 
 *   2) The same FragmentId (immutable) value for all entities of a model
 *      Used to map to an editorKit
 *      Initialized by IEntity.setModel: copy down the hierarchy if unsetted(TODO replace behavior)
 *      ...called by PrototypeManager.clone
 *      ...called by makeRootEntity during JavaStore model building and prototype initialization
 *      ...called by notifyChanged on a setter call (must not change fragmentId!)
 *   3) The same FragmentRoot entity for all entities of a fragment
 *      Used to navigate upward (with fragment granularity)
 *      Used also to grant alternating fragment types
 *      Mantained by IEntity.setModel: copy down the hierarchy,
 *      AbstractFragments set itself as fragmentRoot for children model
