Whole Platform
==============


Installation Notes
------------------

The recommended way to install the Whole Platform is to download the
Whole Language Workbench executable for your platform.
Simply, unpack and run the application.
(NB A 64 bit version of the Java SE 9 or newer is required)

To add the Whole Platform to an existing Eclipse installation
use the Update site or the Update site Archive.
(https://whole.sourceforge.io/updates points to the last version)

The Whole Platform sources are distributed with several bundled examples.
Additional examples are available as a separate archive.
Import the zip files into the Eclipse's workspace using the
"Existing Projects into Workspace" import wizard.
