   **** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****
   The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software
   libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to be valid
   for this artwork library too.
   KDE Crystal theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is
   an artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User
   Interface, or GUI.
   Source code, for this library means:
   - for vectors svg;
   - for pixels, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
   otherwise png.
   The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry notices.
   With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful. With
   this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
   containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
   The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License
   covers the use of elements of this art library in a GUI. kde-artists

   Legal Terms
   ===========
   0. Definitions
   --------------
   Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and
   `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by
   the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the
   `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
   `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
   code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This
   program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.
   This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType
   Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless
   otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as
   distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not
   a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to
   verify this.
   The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,
   Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as
   specified below.
   1. No Warranty
   --------------
   THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT
   WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
   CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
   2. Redistribution
   -----------------
   This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
   irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
   display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
   the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and
   derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to
   exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the
   following conditions:
   o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
   (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the
   original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
   documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files
   must be preserved in all copies of source files.
   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states
   that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team,
   in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL
   to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't
   mandatory.
   These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
   FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work,
   you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
   3. Advertising
   --------------
   Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the
   name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
   without specific prior written permission.
   We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
   following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or
   advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',
   `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
   As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept
   it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only
   this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you
   the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using,
   distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you
   understand and accept all the terms of this license.
   4. Contacts
   -----------

   o freetype@freetype.org
   Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future
   and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are
   looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything
   to help you in the documentation.
   o devel@freetype.org
   Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific
   licenses, porting, etc.
   o http://www.freetype.org
   Holds the current FreeType web page, which will allow you to download

   The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
   implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
   merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is
   provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its
   quality and accuracy.
   This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights
   Reserved except as specified below.
   Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
   software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject
   to these conditions:
   (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
   then this README file must be included, with this copyright and
   no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes
   to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
   documentation.
   (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
   documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
   work of the Independent JPEG Group".
   (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
   accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
   authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
   These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
   IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you
   ought to acknowledge us.
   Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
   company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or
   products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as
   "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
   We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
   basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability
   claims are assumed by the product vendor.
   ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
   Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises
   of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright
   and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the
   Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source
   code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full
   details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
   program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
   the foregoing paragraphs do.
   The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
   Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
   freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts
   (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support
   script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely
   distributable.
   It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
   covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence
   arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more
   licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been
   removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides
   only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely
   that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are
   aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
   The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
   files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading
   support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been
   simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use
   the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but
   are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
   We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
   the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a
   Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

       trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
       modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
       Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
       (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
       of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and
       offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or
       portions thereof).



   (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
   on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under
   the terms of this License.

   (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
   granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
   separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by:
   i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
   Original Code with other software or devices.

   2.2. Contributor Grant.
   Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
   hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

       (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
       trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
       display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
       created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
       unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
       (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
       of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
       combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
       combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
       and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
       Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
       Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
       Version (or portions of such combination).
       (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
       effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
       the Covered Code.
       (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
       granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
       Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
       3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
       Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
       by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
       Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
       infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
       that Contributor.

   3. Distribution Obligations.
   3.1. Application of License.
       The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
       governed by the terms of this License, including without
       limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
       may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
       future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
       must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
       Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
       Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
       version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
       However, You may include an additional document offering the
       additional rights described in Section 3.5.
       3.2. Availability of Source Code.
       Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
       be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
       License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
       an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
       you made an Executable version available; and if made available
       via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
       at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
       available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
       of that particular Modification has been made available to such
       recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
       version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
       Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
       3.3. Description of Modifications.
       You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
       a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
       Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
       statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
       indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
       and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
       Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
       documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
       Covered Code.
       3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

   (a) Third Party Claims.
       If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
       intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
       granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
       must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
       "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim
       in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
       If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is
       made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
       promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
       available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
       appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
       inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
       been obtained.
       (b) Contributor APIs.
       If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
       interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
       are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
       also include this information in the LEGAL file.

             (c)    Representations.
   Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
       3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
       Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
       Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
       this License.

   3.5. Required Notices.
   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
   Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
   Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
   to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
   You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
   Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
   for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
   rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
   charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
   obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
   may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
   Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
   any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
   offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
   Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
   Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
   You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
   requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
   and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
   the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
   including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
   obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
   in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
   collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
   Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
   Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
   contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
   compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
   Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
   rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
   License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
   license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
   from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
   Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
   Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
   the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
   terms You offer.

   3.7. Larger Works.
   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
   not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
   Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
   requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
       License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
       statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
       with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
       (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
       description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
       Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
       Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
       regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
       recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   5. Application of this License.
   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
       attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   6. Versions of the License.
   6.1. New Versions.
       Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish
       revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
       version will be given a distinguishing version number.
       6.2. Effect of New Versions.
       Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
       the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
       that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
       the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
       Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
       terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
       6.3. Derivative Works.
       If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
       may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
       Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
       license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',
       ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do
       not appear in your license (except to note that your license
       differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
       Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
       Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in
       the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in
       the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
       deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
       INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
       FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
       NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
       OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
       DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
       OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
       ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
       AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   8. TERMINATION.
   8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
       cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
       All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
       shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which,
       by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
       this License shall survive.
       8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
       infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
       Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
       Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
       "Participant")  alleging that:
       (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
       Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
       shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
       prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
       You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
       agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
       Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
       litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
       such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
       royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
       writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
       the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
       2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
       period specified above.
       (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such
       Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
       Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective
       as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had
       made, Modifications made by that Participant.
       8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against
       Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
       directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
       resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
       initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
       value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
       2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
       or value of any payment or license.
       8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
       above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
       and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
       distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
       termination.

   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
       (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
       INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
       COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
       ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
       DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
       FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
       MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
       EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
       SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
       LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
       NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
       SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
       INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
       LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
   The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
       48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer
       software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as
       such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
       with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
       (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
       with only those rights set forth herein.

   11. MISCELLANEOUS.
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
       matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
       by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,
       if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
       provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party
       is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
       business in the United States of America, any litigation relating
       to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
       Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue
       lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
       responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
       and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
       the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
       Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
       provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
       against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
       responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
       indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
       and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
       distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
       herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
       of liability.

   13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
       "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
       Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code
       under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any,
       specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
       Exhibit A.

   The VIGRA Artistic License
   ==========================
   (modeled after the Perl Artistic License)
   Preamble
   --------
   The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which
   VIGRA may be copied, such that the author maintains some semblance of
   artistic control over the development of the library, while giving the
   users of the library the right to use and distribute VIGRA in a
   more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
   modifications.
   Definitions
   -----------
   "Copyright Holder" of the VIGRA library is Ullrich Koethe, Cognitive
   Systems Group, University of Hamburg, Germany.
   "Library" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
   Copyright Holder under the name "VIGRA" (including this LICENSE file
   and all accompanying documentation), and derivatives of that
   collection of files created through textual modification.
   "Standard Version" refers to the Library if it has not been modified,
   or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
   Holder as specified below.
   "You" is you, if you're thinking about using, copying, modifying or
   distributing this Library.
   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item. It also
   means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
   conditions they received it.
   "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
   media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
   (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
   only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear
   the fee.)
   License terms
   -------------
   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the Standard Version
   of this Library without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices, this license, and associated
   disclaimers.
   2. The Standard Version of the Library may be distributed as part of a
   collection of software, provided no more than a reasonable copying fee
   is charged for the software collection.
   3. You may apply bug fixes and portability fixes derived from the
   Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Library modified in such
   a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
   4. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Library in any way,
   provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
   stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
   at least ONE of the following:
   a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
   them Freely Available, for example by allowing the Copyright Holder to
   include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Library.
   b. use the modified Library only within your corporation or
   organization.
   c. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
   5. You may distribute programs which use this Library in object code
   or executable form without restriction.
   6. Any object code generated as a result of using this Library does
   not fall under the copyright of this Library, but belongs to whomever
   generated it, and may be sold commercially.
   7. The name of the Copyright Holder or the Library may not be used to
   endorse or promote products derived from this software without
   specific prior written permission.
   8. THIS LIBRARY IS PROVIDED AS IS AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR ANY
   DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS,
   WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR ON ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
   PERFORMANCE OF THIS LIBRARY.

   The LaTeX Project Public License
   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
   LPPL Version 1.3b 2006-01-07
   Copyright 1999 2002-2006 LaTeX3 Project
   Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license
   document, but modification of it is not allowed.
   PREAMBLE
   ========
   The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
   which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are
   distributed.
   You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
   and which you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly
   suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
   you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated
   to TeX.
   The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
   below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
   who are considering distributing their works under this license.
   This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
   and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
   that work may be distributed.
   We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the
   freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that
   conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
   maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work.
   If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these
   conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex'
   in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.
   DEFINITIONS
   ===========
   In this license document the following terms are used:
   `Work' Any work being distributed under this License.
   `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from
   the Work.
   `Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
   applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
   original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
   such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   into another language.
   `Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
   applicable law.
   `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to
   another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not
   limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
   file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems
   such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
   `Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a
   form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing
   may include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
   transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
   other activities. Note that modification of any installation
   facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
   `Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the
   Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the
   `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.
   `Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for
   running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.
   A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not
   considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external
   component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively.
   Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the
   only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of
   files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX
   language'.
   CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
   ===========================================
   1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
   are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In
   particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
   requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
   2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
   received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
   modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
   Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
   3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
   complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
   above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
   the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
   as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
   directly from the Work.
   4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
   restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may
   also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
   Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works
   distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
   be updated versions of the Work.
   5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
   your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
   and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
   the Derived Work.
   6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
   distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
   for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
   in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only
   the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
   to a component of the Work.
   a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for
   a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base
   Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies
   itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter,
   the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and
   unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this
   component to the user when used interactively with that Base
   Interpreter.
   b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
   detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent
   reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived
   Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.
   c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
   including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of
   the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the
   reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work
   unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such
   support for the Derived Work.
   d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
   1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a
   modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified
   component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
   copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
   condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   Work along with the modified component;
   2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified
   copy of the Work.
   7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
   distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
   the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
   Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
   regard to the Derived Work.
   8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
   apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
   becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work
   as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
   9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
   format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
   then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax
   or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results
   of applying that process.
   10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
   provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6
   above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the
   rest of the conditions in this license.
   b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
   Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself
   to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions
   in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
   11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
   the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
   such works with the Work by any means.
   12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
   complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
   NO WARRANTY
   ===========
   There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in
   writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
   limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
   a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
   performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective,
   you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
   In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
   will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of
   the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work
   as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any
   general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
   any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including,
   but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or
   losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to
   operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said
   author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such
   damages.
   MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
   =======================
   The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
   explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
   the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
   or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
   The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
   who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
   reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
   address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
   or act upon these error reports.
   The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
   is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
   Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
   of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
   significant signs of active maintenance.
   You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
   any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
   If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
   the Work through the following steps:
   1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the
   Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet
   or similar search.
   2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is
   still maintained.
   a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to
   update their communication data within one month.
   b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
   maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within
   the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If
   the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting
   to comp.text.tex.)
   3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
   maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately
   upon announcement.
   b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder
   agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes
   effect immediately upon announcement.
   4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
   and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the
   Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people,
   then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as
   the (new) Current Maintainer.
   5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable
   once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of
   3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the
   Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their
   communication data within one month.
   A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
   that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
   If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
   immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
   statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also
   announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b)
   above.
   WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
   ======================================================
   This section contains important instructions, examples, and
   recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
   works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this
   section.
   Choosing This License or Another License
   ----------------------------------------
   If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
   conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
   do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
   distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text
   of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
   should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
   your work is distributed under the LPPL.
   The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
   the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for
   example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License
   (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to
   LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and
   authors intending to distribute their works under any license are
   encouraged to read it.
   A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
   -----------------------------------------------------
   It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
   personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
   distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such
   modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
   accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
   it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
   version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
   of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
   cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best
   interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one.
   Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without
   altering any of its licensed components.
   How to Use This License
   -----------------------
   To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
   an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
   was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a
   statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component
   is constrained by the conditions in this license.
   Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
   %% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name % % This work may be
   distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX
   Project Public License, either version 1.3 % of this license or (at
   your option) any later version. % The latest version of this license
   is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.3 or
   later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 2005/12/01 or
   later. % % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'. % %
   The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name. % % This work
   consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file
   pig.sty.
   Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in
   this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the
   three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
   generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
   referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
   `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
   If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
   Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. However, we
   recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was
   added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the
   community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
   yourself.
   Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
   ---------------------------------------
   Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
   stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
   with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
   (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this
   is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
   completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
   Important Recommendations
   -------------------------
   Defining What Constitutes the Work
   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files
   of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the
   licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for
   example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work
   near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as:
   % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
   in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to
   comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled
   to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.
